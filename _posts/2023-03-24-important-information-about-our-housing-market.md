Coming into the late spring and summer season, it's important to stay updated on the Charleston market, as a lot of things are changing.&nbsp;

First, we have 22 new multifamily listings, which is on par with last year. Nine have sold within the last month, which is half of what was sold last year. Also, **days on market is down significantly**, at 29 days compared to 64 days at this time last year.

In addition, prices are up 11% from last year and 1.8% from last month. Inventory is still limited, and sales are down because debt service is so expensive, which means a rougher terrain for buyers to navigate. **I've seen more creatively financed or cash deals in the last two months than I've seen in the last two years.**

Sellers are still listing their properties at high prices, but they're not obtaining as much of the list price as they were this time last year. **This data tells me that a well-priced, well-positioned, marketable property will have no problem selling in today's market, and probably at a faster pace than this time last year.&nbsp;**

Now that you're better informed about the state of the market, you must ensure that you're working with a qualified commercial real estate professional who understands the market forces. If you have any questions or want to know more about how I can help you with your real estate investment goals, reach out to me at any time by phone call or email. I hope to hear from you soon.
