If you want to invest in real estate or already have, you should know that one thing can make or break your experience and the resale value of that property. The biggest decision you make after you close is deciding on the right property manager. I’ve seen this affect many sellers in our area, so I’m here to equip you with three things you should be looking for when you choose a property manager:&nbsp;

{% include excerpt.html %}

**1\. Do they lease the property at market rate?** A good property manager will, and they understand that there’s a balance between vacancy and pushing rent prices too far. If you go to resell the property, the first thing that many agents will look at is the rent price you are currently receiving, so make sure it’s close to market value.&nbsp;

**2\. Do they qualify candidates?** You want someone who is looking for the applicant’s eviction and credit history, verifying their income, talking to their employers, and more. A good property manager should be making sure that the tenants are right because having bad renters can cause a wide variety of issues, including getting your property trashed, getting late payments, and needing to evict someone. Eviction is also something that can affect future resale value because if you have a few months of missing rent, a buyer might start asking a lot of questions that could kill your deal. Therefore, avoid all of this by making sure to find a property manager that will thoroughly qualify tenants.&nbsp;

**3\. Do they work on preventative maintenance?** This is the most important quality of a good property manager—they should be on the ball protecting your investment. For example, here in Charleston we occasionally have hurricanes, so you want to make sure you have someone who attends to the property beforehand to minimize possible damage; afterward they should make sure to attend to damage as soon as possible.&nbsp;
