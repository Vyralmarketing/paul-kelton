Today, I'm sharing a secret in the tax code that applies to commercial property that not many people know about.

Clients ask me this question all the time: “Don't you think taxes are a little bit high in South Carolina?” The truth is that it is a little high, but there is an exemption to the tax code, and it's called the ATI exemption.

**What is the ATI exemption?** It is an exemption of 25% on your property that has a 6% tax assessment ratio. That means that if your property has been a commercial or an investment property and you are keeping it as a commercial or an investment property, you get a 25% exemption. All you have to do is record the form at the Tax Auditor's office by January 31.

**Why doesn't everybody know about this?** It's a little-known fact in the tax code, and it requires you to go in-person to file it. If you're not working with somebody local, who's commercial-oriented, and who knows the ins and outs of this, it's tough to find out about these exemptions.

Not all agents are created equal. That's why you must work with somebody who's commercial-oriented here in Charleston. That’s why you should choose me. Remember, if you have any questions about this exemption or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to be your resource for all of your real estate needs.
