Have you considered investing in a short-term rental property? It is a fantastic way to make passive income, but there are rules you need to know about before getting started. Here are three things you should be aware of before getting into short-term rentals:&nbsp;

**1\. Zoning laws.** Here in Charleston, zoning regulations around short-term rentals are pretty strict. There is a specific part of town where you are allowed to have a short-term rental; everywhere else, they aren’t allowed. Make sure you work with a professional so that you comply with the necessary zoning laws.

**2\. Building requirements.** To have a short-term rental, the building must be shaped a certain way, have a fire system, have the right parking spaces, and so on. The city puts limits on what you can do with your building, but many people think it’s worth it.&nbsp;

**3\. Consider a plan b.** If short-term rentals seem like too much hassle, you can always consider a month-to-month rental instead. These have many of the same benefits as short-term rentals but sidestep a lot of their pitfalls.&nbsp;

I know this seems like a lot, but short-term rentals remain the single best way to make income off your real estate investment in Charleston. Call or email me with any questions; I’d love to speak with you about your plans.
