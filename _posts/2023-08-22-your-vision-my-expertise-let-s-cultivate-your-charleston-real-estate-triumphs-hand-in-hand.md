These key players include experienced property owners who regularly transact real estate, inheritors of legacy properties, serial buyers deeply invested in Charleston's real estate, local lenders who grasp the property's value, local property managers serving as your on-ground asset handlers. Additionally, there are other crucial individuals such as local attorneys, contractors, connections to city officials, engineers, architects, and many more.

Thanks to my deep roots in this domain, I possess a unique expertise. I have an in-depth understanding of every recent sale, enabling me to be a true pricing specialist.
