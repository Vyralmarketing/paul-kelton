The center of Charleston is currently downtown, but it’s moving to the center of 526 and I-26. There have been some major developments in the last couple of years, and **a lot of projects have been announced for the next few years.&nbsp;**

Roper St. Francis has announced that they are investing $1 billion into a new hospital facility in the area. They see the potential for growth there, so they’re closing down their hospital downtown and moving all of the jobs to this area in North Charleston. The Lowcountry Rapid Transit system has been in the works for a couple of years. It is due to open in 2026 and will be the first mass transit system in Charleston. It will go from Ladson to downtown, and the center of it will be in this area. The final major development project is the old naval base redevelopment. This area will be a mixed-use space for multifamily units, offices, retail spaces, and parks. They're going to make this space very nice.

So what does this mean for you, and how can you take advantage of this? **Property values have not yet caught up to the investments that are happening here**, so there are quite a few good deals on the market. There's a lot of property that is undervalued for the potential that it has in the future. This area will become a center for jobs and economic stability, and these could be the lowest prices that we’ll ever see in this area. Take advantage of this opportunity now and ride this wave.
