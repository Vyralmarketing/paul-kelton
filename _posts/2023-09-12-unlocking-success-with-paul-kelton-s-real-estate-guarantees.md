I'm Paul Kelton, your trusted multi-family real estate broker here in Charleston, South Carolina. Over the past three years, my team and I have dedicated ourselves to crafting a marketing system that stands out in our beautiful city. Today, we're excited to share with you four of our guarantees that set us apart from those you choose to work with.

**Guarantee \#1: Best Aspect Marketing**

Every property has its unique qualities. Whether it's the location, the zoning, or the value-add potential. We identify and highlight this aspect, ensuring it captures the attention of your best buyer. Most brokerages will generalize this information, which could lead to confusion for the buyer. However, we take this confusion away by providing a crystal clear picture of the property's best use.

**Guarantee \#2: 1,000 View Guarantee**

We hit the ground running, ensuring that your property gets maximum exposure in its first week. We guarantee that you will have 1,000 views in your first week on the market from two different MLS systems. We have platforms like Courtesy and LoopNet, have an expansive database of over 40,000 buyers, and have our local brokers' connections.

**Guarantee \#3: Professional Marketing Package**

We believe in making a stellar first impression. Rest assured, your property will be showcased with professional photography and a meticulously designed package. We have an exclusive relationship with the best photographer in Charleston, who will ensure that your property leaves a lasting impression.

**Guarantee \#4: Clear Communication Guarantee**

We've heard your concerns about brokers going radio silent. With us, you're guaranteed regular updates about market trends, buyer interest, comparable sales, and our expert recommendations. Our clients are our most valuable relationships and it is incredibly important to us that you are well-informed throughout your real estate journey.

Your satisfaction and peace of mind are our top priorities. These are just four of our seven guarantees that come standard with all of our listings. We don't just make promises. We stand by them, ensuring that you get the best service possible. If you're curious about our other guarantees or have questions, please don't hesitate to call or email. Together, let's make your property the talk of Charleston.
