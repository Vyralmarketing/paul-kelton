What is the most valuable piece of real estate on the East Coast? If that’s what you’re looking for, let me tell you about Union Port. It is a 176-acre piece of real estate that’s right in downtown Charleston overlooking the harbor, and is a blank slate for developers to come in and build on top of what is already our beautiful downtown.&nbsp;

Union Port has historically been a shipping port, and it has been owned by the Port Authority for over 100 years. The Port Authority recently has been leasing out the land to different cruise lines, but with what has happened with the real estate market over the past two years, the Port Authority has realized that it is way more beneficial to sell this land than to keep it as a cruise terminal.

They decided to sell the land and hired a national firm to build a development plan. What does this all mean for you? There are several of neighborhoods bordering this land, and they present fantastic opportunities for you. One of the most notable is the East Side.

**The East Side will rise tremendously in value with the improvements that will happen.** The developments include mixed-use spaces, retail, and restaurants. They're also building a city right next to downtown Charleston.

If you want to take advantage of this opportunity while the project is still in its infancy or have any real estate questions, call or email me. I’d be happy to connect with you.
