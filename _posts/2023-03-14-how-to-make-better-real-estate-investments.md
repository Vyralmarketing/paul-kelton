Investing in real estate can be a great way to build wealth over the long run, but it can also be a daunting task for many people. Luckily, there's a simple "cheat code" that you can use to make investing in real estate easier: the Chick-fil-A rule.

This rule says you should invest in real estate in areas where Chick-fil-A is opening or has existing stores. The reasoning behind this rule is simple: Chick-fil-A is a major player in the fast-food industry, and **when they invest in an area, they do so after extensive market research and analysis.**

When Chick-fil-A invests in an area, they look at a variety of factors, including demographics, growth trends, and infrastructure. They want to make sure that the area is a good place to do business and that there is a strong customer base to support their stores. Chick-fil-A invests over $2 million into each of their stores, so they're not going to waste that investment on an area that doesn't meet their criteria.

By investing in real estate in areas where Chick-fil-A is opening or has existing stores, **you can piggyback off of their market research and analysis.** This will help you be confident that the area has been vetted by professionals and that there is potential for growth and appreciation. Plus, with Chick-fil-A's strong brand recognition and loyal customer base, having Chick-fil-A nearby can be a great draw for other businesses in the area.

To apply this rule to your investments, start by doing some research on where Chick-fil-A has existing stores in your area. Take note of the demographics and growth trends in those areas and see if there are any patterns. For example, do Chick-fil-A stores tend to be located in more affluent areas with strong job growth? If so, those areas may be good candidates for real estate investment.

You can also look for areas where Chick-fil-A is opening new stores. This can be a strong indicator of growth potential in the area. For example, if Chick-fil-A is opening a new store in a suburb that is experiencing rapid population growth, that may be a good sign that the area is poised for continued growth and appreciation.

**In the Charleston area, there are currently 17 Chick-fil-A restaurants spread across different demographics and sub-markets.** The most recent one is in Summerville off State Road, right across from Cain Bay. This area is seeing strong growth trends and may be a good place to invest.

If you have any questions about this or the Charleston area, don't hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
