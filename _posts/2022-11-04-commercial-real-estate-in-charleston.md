My name is Paul Kelton, and today I’m here to tell you a little about who I am and talk about some of the opportunities in the Charleston area.

I've known Charleston my whole life. I’m intimately familiar with downtown Charleston, the suburbs, and the major highways, so I understand the ways that the different municipalities work together in the Charleston area.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

For the past three and a half years, I've been blessed to work within the real estate market. In that time, I've been able to help numerous clients obtain cash-flowing assets that are good for the future of their businesses. **There are a lot of opportunities to take advantage of in the Charleston market.**

Those opportunities are usually close to our major assets, which include the Medical University of South Carolina, the Joint Naval Air Force Base, our robust port and logistics industry that surrounds that, our tourism, and a very strong business district in downtown Charleston.&nbsp;

I've helped clients purchase apartment buildings, sell and buy warehouse space, grow their businesses in the retail sector, and open new offices. No matter what you're looking for in commercial real estate in the Charleston area, I'm the person that you should be talking to. Call or text me, or stop by the office. Let's talk about the opportunities here in the Charleston area. I look forward to hearing from you.
