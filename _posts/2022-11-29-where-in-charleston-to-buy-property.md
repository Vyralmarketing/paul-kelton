Where should you invest in Charleston? The short answer is it depends on your situation. However, there are a few places that stand out to me as high-growth areas that every serious investor should consider. Here are three locations in Charleston where you may want to consider buying an investment property:

**1\. Moncks Corner.** It’s a sleepy town right now, but the land is cheap, and development costs are low. It's a great place to look at if you're looking to do a subdivision, a small multifamily, or if you’re searching for an industrial property with a growing population. It’s also very affordable—the average price point is around $360,000, which is within the range of most people who are looking to invest and live in the property.

**2\. Goose Creek.** I met the mayor of Goose Creek last year, and he told me they needed more industry and business in the area. They want to revamp the downtown area and transform it into a completely different town in the next five years. It's slightly out of the central location of Charleston, but it is very well connected with Red Bank Road and Highway 78 and relatively close to I-26.

**3\. Summerville.** This area has experienced explosive growth over the past five years. It used to be a sleepy community where people from Charleston would go during the summertime. However, now it's completely different. They are building mega-developments that are some of the best in the country. Also, this area has a lot of manufacturing plants and a logistics industry. They have plenty of land to build on and have been of high interest to a lot of developers over the past couple of years.

All of these towns have the potential for high growth in the future. If you'd like to discuss more on the specific areas and the best places to invest, please give me a call or send an email. I’m happy to connect with you\!
