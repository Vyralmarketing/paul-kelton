If you've ever been to Charleston, you may have noticed the towering presence of the paper mill when crossing over the Don Holt Bridge on I-526. However, today, we have some exciting news to share. WestRock, the owner of the paper mill, has announced its closure, effective August 31. This is a monumental win for the city of Charleston and the entire surrounding community.

For years, the paper mill has been associated with unpleasant smells and being an eyesore on the Cooper River, but thanks to its closure, we can now breathe a sigh of relief. Here are three reasons why the closure of the paper mill is a huge win for North Charleston:

**1\. Improved quality of life.** The sulfuric smells that once tainted the area will no longer linger in the air. That means that residents and visitors can now enjoy a fresher and cleaner North Charleston.

**2\. Environmental restoration.** The Cooper River and its surrounding ecosystem can now recover from the impact of industrial activities. The closure allows for potential revitalization of the area, creating a healthier and more sustainable environment.

**3\. Economic redevelopment.** The site can be repurposed for new commercial ventures, bringing in investment and job opportunities for the community. The removal of the paper mill's presence paves the way for a fresh start and a vibrant future for North Charleston.

With the closure of the paper mill and the presence of other investments in the area, North Charleston is on the path to a brighter and more promising future. If you want more information about the potential of this exciting transformation, call or email me. Iâ€™m always happy to help!
