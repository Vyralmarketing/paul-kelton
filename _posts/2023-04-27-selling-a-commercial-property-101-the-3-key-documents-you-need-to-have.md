Are you planning on selling your commercial real estate property? If so, there are three main documents you need, and I’ll go over each of them briefly today:

**1\. Rent roll.** This includes the current rents you have, the expiration dates, and the bed and bathroom counts for each unit.&nbsp;

**2\. List of improvements.** You need to state any upgrades you’ve made because they greatly impact the value of your property.&nbsp;

**3\. Trailing/G 12.** This document breaks down your revenue, expenses, and profit. Make sure to separate your operating costs and capital improvement costs.&nbsp;

As always, don’t hesitate to call or email me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
