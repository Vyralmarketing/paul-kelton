Are you a property owner in South Carolina and looking for ways to save on your property tax bill? Then you’d probably like to know about the Assessable Transfer of Interest or ATI exemption. When you are looking for a property in South Carolina or Charleston, one of the common concerns is the tax implications.

Although taxes can be high depending on the property that you want to buy in the municipality, there is a way that you can lower them. Applying for the ATI exemption can lower your tax bill by taking 25% off your property’s value calculation.

For example, if your property is worth $100,000, you would only be taxed on $75,000 after filing the ATI exemption—however, **this only** **applies to nonresidential properties that are assessed at a normal 6% value.** The form for this exemption can be found on the local county municipality website. My team and I will also be happy to provide you with some resources to apply for this exemption.

It is important to note that the deadline for submission of this form to the state is January 30, 2024, for the 2023 tax year. A lot of people are not aware of this opportunity because it is a relatively new law in the state of South Carolina and has a tight deadline. This is why it is important to work with someone who understands the laws and ordinances in South Carolina.
