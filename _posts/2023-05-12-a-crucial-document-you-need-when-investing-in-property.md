When I inquire about expenses with property owners, they typically send me an operating statement. However, this is not the ideal document to share with potential buyers. Instead, we recommend sending a T-12 or trailing 12, which I discussed in my previous video. Let me explain what that is.

**First, what is an operating statement?** It's akin to a bank account statement, reflecting all transactions that have occurred at the property over the past year, including operating costs, capital improvements, and every other expense. When I send this document to potential buyers, they tend to react in one of two ways.

Either they scrutinize the operating statement in detail and become intimidated by the overwhelming amount of information, or they don't look at it at all, prompting them to ask us again for specific expense breakdowns by category. This means you'll need to go back and gather the data the buyer is requesting, adding to your workload.

**On the other hand, a trailing 12 is a summary of revenue, operating costs, net operating income, and capital improvements over the past 12 months**, presented in a clear and concise format. This enables the buyer to get a comprehensive view of the property's performance quickly and easily.

So why do we recommend sharing a T-12 instead of an operating statement? It provides a clear picture for buyers to make their best offer in the shortest amount of time, and it saves you time in the long run by facilitating a faster property sale.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about T-12 or operating statements and how they relate to your property, please call or email me. Let's talk through your options.
