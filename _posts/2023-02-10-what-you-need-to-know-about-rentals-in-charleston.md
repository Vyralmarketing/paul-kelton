Charleston has been the No. 1 tourist destination in the world for the past ten years, and its popularity only continues to grow. With such high demand, short-term rentals have become an increasingly popular option for visitors and investors alike. However, the rules and regulations surrounding short-term rentals in Charleston are not as straightforward as one may hope. Today I’m diving into the two main reasons why short-term rentals in Charleston can be so complicated:

**1\. High tourist demand.** Charleston's status as the world's top tourist destination has led to an immense interest in short-term rentals. With so many visitors flocking to the city each year, the demand for short-term rental properties is at an all-time high. Plus, this high demand means that there are more regulations and restrictions in place to manage it.

**2\. So many municipalities.** The Charleston area is made up of 27 different municipalities, each with its own interpretation of how to handle the high demand for short-term rentals. This means that each one has its own set of rules and regulations, leading to a complex and ever-changing landscape for those looking to invest in this industry. For example, Folly Beach may have different rules and regulations than downtown Charleston, and Mount Pleasant may have a different approach than North Charleston. It’s crucial to understand the unique nuances of each municipality.&nbsp;
